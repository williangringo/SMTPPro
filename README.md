SMTPPro
=======

When I saw this extension on Magento-Connect, I read some of user review. 
Unfortunately, I saw this review like "nice extension but not working with ASchroder_SMTPPro....email logging not working". 
So, I updated some potion of code. But, original author is Ashley Schroder and WebFlakeStudio.

If you want to add these code, you should already add SMTPPro Extension. After your installation is complte, you will see 
SMTPPro Folder on yourmagentofolder/app/code/community/Aschroder. 

Code changes have Block,etc, Helper and Model Only. I can't 100% warrant to this codes. But, when I tested on Magento 1.7.0.2, it's work. 
After you added, Go To admin panel, Disable Email Notification under System->Configuration->System. 


Ps. Original Code Author is Ashley Schroder (aschroder.com) and WebFlakeStudio. Hope can help for this extension.
